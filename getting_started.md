##Getting Started with Github
Create a github account. www.github.com
Github is cloud storage for code. So much can be found on github. This is how i will be assigning and collecting work. Donâ€™t worry, I will be showing how to use github and git in class.
*make sure you download the github desktop app*

##Getting Started with Slack
Wait for an email from Slack. Follow the sign-up procedure.

You can always use Slack through the browser, but I suggest downloading the desktop app. 

##Get Sublime Text
Visit https://www.sublimetext.com/. Grab a download for your system. 

##Need a review or want to get ahead?
For HTML and CSS review, try Project 1 and 2 at https://dash.generalassemb.ly/
For Javasciprt, try https://www.codecademy.com/ for some intro lessons, I will be going over everything in detail in class as well.
