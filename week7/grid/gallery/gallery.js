// this exercise has two objectives
// 1) get you comfortable with the jquery docs
// 2) get you to build something fun

// before you get started
// Read up on the jquery .attr and .val methods 

//don't overthink this, probably don't need a nested loop here!

// write a function called make
// grab the value from the input box
// make a loop that goes from 1 to the number that was in the input
// inside the loop
    // use jquery to create an image
    // assign the image a src attribute 
    // hint: the images are in a folder called subway
// hint 2: the images are named by a number, for example the first image will
// have the file path 'subway/1.gif'
// append the image to the wrapper

// is the document ready?
// add a click function to the make button

// Bonus!
// hmm, it just keeps adding images to the button when I run it again
// how can you clear the wrapper?

// Bonus 2
// When you click an image, make it disappear
// hint: the images won't exist when the dom is created
