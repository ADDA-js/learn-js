# Simple Calc

## Objective
- I can use inputs from the users to build a simple calculator. 
- I can use conditional statements to control a program.

## Directions
Build a simple calculator that takes two numbers from the user and an operation and returns an answer.

Your calculator should perform the following operations.
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide

** Bonus **
- Calculate the remainder when a number is divided
- Calculate an exponent, first number is base, second is power.

** Super Bonus **
- Add "edge casing!" If a user inputs a string in place of a number, remind them to use a number. If a user write an operation that you didn't program in, ask them to choose again.

## Psuedo Code
*Use this if you are having trouble getting started*

1. Create a variable to store the operation, called `op`.
2. prompt the user for the operation they want, let them know their choices.
3. Store the users response as in `op`.
4. Create a variable for the first number, call `num1`.
5. Prompt the user for their first number.
6. Store in `num1`.
7. Create a variable for the first number, call `num2`.
8. Prompt the user for their second number.
9. Store in `num2`.
10. Use `if/else` blocks to see which operation the user selected
11. Create a variable `ans` for the answer.
12. Calculate the answer and store in the variable `ans`
13. alert the user about the answer
