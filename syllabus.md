*ADDA 2016 - Javascript*

## Long term goals
------
- I can design and build dynamic, interactive websites using Javascript, Jquery, and APIs.
- I can develop web apps that us a database and follow the Model View Control design structure built with Node, Express, and MongoDB.

## Class Expectations
------
As students, you are expected to come to every class on time and prepared. In class you are expected to engage in class discussions and excercises. You should communicate with your instructor any needs that you may have. If you must miss a class, let the instructor know prior to the session. If you feel that you are falling behind you need to seek help from either your peers, ADDA alums, or your instructor.

As with any learning experience, you are going to get out of this course what you put in. To that end you should grapple with all in class excercises, homework assignments, and challenge problems. You will build two fully functioning web apps of your own design. This is no small feat.

## Materials and Resources
------
-[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), good reference. There are code challenges at the end of each chapter, you can write and test your code directly in the browser.
-[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), definitive documentation on Javascript.
-[W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/), good documentation, a little easier to read that MDN.
-[Node School](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers), tutorials on javascript, git, and node.
-[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), mathy and logic challenges. Can be solved in any langauge, solutions can usually be found online. I think they are fun.
