*ADDA 2017 - Javascript*

## Objectives 
------
- I can design and build dynamic, interactive websites using Javascript, Jquery, and APIs.
- I can use JavaScript in the Wordpress ecoystem.

## Expectations
------
- Be comfortable with not getting something on the first try.
- Arrive on time, ready to participate.
- Inform instructor of absences in advance of class, find a way to make up work.
- Communicate needs to instructor, teaching assistant, or ADDA representatives.
- Play with code. Itâ€™s good to break things.
- Work on assigned homework and projects

## Out of Class Assignments
------
There will be some work outside of class. This is meant to reinforce concepts covered each week. Often these will be short readings or videos aligned to weekly content. At times you will be finishing exercises started in class. Instruction will proceed assuming that you are putting in the work to stay up to speed with the class. You are expected to submit completed homework through Canvas.

## Communication
------
- Use slack or email to communicate with instructor.
- All class content will be posted on Canvas.

## Materials and Resources
------
- [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), good reference. There are code challenges at the end of each chapter, you can write and test your code directly in the browser.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), definitive documentation on Javascript.
- [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/), good documentation, a little easier to read that MDN.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), mathy and logic challenges. Can be solved in any langauge, solutions can usually be found online. I think they are fun.
