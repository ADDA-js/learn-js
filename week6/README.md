# Week 6 - Project Week

## Objective
- I can build an interactive game using javascript and jquery.

## Game Options
Choose one of the game options...
+ Memory
+ TicTacToe
+ Hangman (most difficult)

I have included Psuedo Code, HTML, a some CSS, for each game. You can use this as a guide while building your game *OR* you can start from scratch you are looking for a challenge.

We will share-out our games in the next class.
