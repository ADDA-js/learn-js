# Week 4

## Objectives
- I can define objects, retrieve object properties, and call their functions.
- I can build object constructors to define object types.
- I can add, update, and delete object from the page using my knowledge of the DOM.
- I can implement event listeners to watch for user interaction.

## HW Part 1: Rewrite hangman using objects and protypes
-[Console Hangman](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/41cb3d432536a53850d98004b3395bf7)
- In terminal, do 'git clone <yourHWRepo>'
- Do your work in this repo.
- Use the psuedo code to get started if you are stuck.
- Commit and push often, push your final project by Tuesday night.

## HW Part 2: Incorporate the DOM
After you get hangman working in the console. Add some sweet DOM manipulation so a user can interact with your program without the conosle or prompts/alerts/etc. You might need to change your change your program a little to make DOM fit in better.

### Features
* As a user, I would like to be able to push a start button and have a game start and render in the browser.
* As a user, I would like to be able to see what letters I've played
* As a user, I would like to be able to see how many guesses I have left
* As a user, I would like to be able to see the current status of the word, with hidden letters represented by underscores and guessed letters represented by their value.
* As a user, I would like to be able to use an input box on the page to guess my letters

### Bonus Features
* As a user, I would like to see a visual for the hangman game. 
* As a user, I would like my letter inputs to be dictated by keypresses, so if I push the `K` key on my keyboard it will guess `k`

## HW Part 3: Start thinking about project 1
- Next week, we will start building our first project, a browser game built in JS with DOM interactions.
- Consider 'classic' games that wouldn't be too intense to build
	+ Tic Tac Toe
	+ Connect Four
	+ Memory
	+ Rock Paper Scissors
	+ Snakes (hard?)
	+ Box Out (hard?)
	+ Choose your own game!
- Come next week with a game in mind
- Write Psuedo code for your game!
