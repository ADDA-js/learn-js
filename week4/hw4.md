[Console Hangman](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/41cb3d432536a53850d98004b3395bf7)

After you get hangman working in the console. Add some sweet DOM manipulation so a user can interact with your program without the conosle or prompts/alerts/etc.

### Features
* As a user, I would like to be able to push a start button and have a game start and render in the browser.
* As a user, I would like to be able to see what letters I've played
* As a user, I would like to be able to see how many guesses I have left
* As a user, I would like to be able to see the current status of the word, with hidden letters represented by underscores and guessed letters represented by their value.
* As a user, I would like to be able to use an input box on the page to guess my letters

### Bonus Features
* As a user, I would like to see a visual for the hangman game. 
* As a user, I would like my letter inputs to be dictated by keypresses, so if I push the `K` key on my keyboard it will guess `k`
